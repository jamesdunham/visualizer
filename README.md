This is a bare-bones visualizer for documents and their annotations.

Usage:

- Launch with `./start.sh` and note the port on which the API is listening
  (e.g., `8000`)
- Pull up documents in your browser at URLs of the pattern
  `localhost:8000/documents?id=3499781`, where `3499781` is the id of a document
  in the databsae.
